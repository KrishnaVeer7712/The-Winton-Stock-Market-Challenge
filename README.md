# The-Winton-Stock-Market-Challenge
The Winton Stock Market Challenge
The purpose of this project is to take on the Winton Stock Market Challenge on Kaggle. The aim of this challenge is to predict intra and end of the day returns using already given historical stock performance and a host of masked features.
Two Neural Network models were used to predict stock returns, whose performance was measured with loss and Mean Square Error.

The Winton StockMarket CIn order to predict the future stock returns, given the data, the best fitting models would be Long Short Term Memory Networks and the Sequential Model. hallenge is a Kaggle contest sponsored by Winton Capital. A machine learning model is to be trained on data consisting of historical stock performance and a host of masked features to predict future intra and end of the day returns.

The different approaches adopted in this project utilize regression using Neural Networks to make future predictions of stock returns. In order to predict the future stock returns, given the data, the best fitting models would be Long Short Term Memory Networks and the Sequential Model.
